%\date{} %%If commented, the current date is used.
\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the degrees of freedom of a standard, hand-pushed lawnmower? Why are you still able to mow your entire lawn? \emph{1pt}
\item What are the maximum degrees of freedom for objects driving on the plane? \emph{1pt}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Write out the entries of a rotation matrix $^A_BR$ assuming basis vectors $X_A$, $Y_A$, $Z_A$, and $X_B$, $Y_B$, $Z_B$. \emph{1pt}
 \item Express $\hat{X}_B=[0, 1, 0]^T$ in frame $\{A\}$. \emph{1pt}
 \item Write out the entries of rotation matrix $^B_AR$. \emph{1pt}
 \item Verify that your solution for $^A\hat{X}_B=^A_BR[0, 1, 0]^T$ indeed reduces to $[0, 1, 0]^T$ when re-expressed in coordinate system $\{B\}$.  Tip: Express multiplications as scalar products and remember that the scalar product of orthogonal vectors is 0 and that of parallel vectors is 1. \emph{1pt}
\end{enumerate} 
\item Consider a tri-cycle with two independent standard wheels in the rear and the stearable front-wheel. Chose a suitable coordinate system and use $\theta$ as the steering wheel angle and wheel-speed $\dot{\omega}$. Provide forward and inverse kinematics. \emph{2pt}
