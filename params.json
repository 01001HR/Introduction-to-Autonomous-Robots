{"name":"Introduction-to-autonomous-robots","tagline":"Introduction to Autonomous Robots","body":"### Overview\r\nThis book introduces concepts in mobile, autonomous robotics to 3rd-4th year students in Computer Science or a related discipline. The book covers principles of robot motion, forward and inverse kinematics of robotic arms and simple wheeled platforms, perception, error propagation, localization and simultaneous localization and mapping. The cover picture shows a wind-up toy that is smart enough to not fall of a table just using intelligent mechanism design and illustrate the importance of the mechanism in designing intelligent, autonomous systems. This book is open source, open to contributions, and released under a creative common license.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
